* Drawer
** General
- implement labels (currently in old draw_region_circular
- improve circ/rect control in draw_region --> i.e. split into smaller functions
- trackpad and apple mouse too sensitive in zooming

** Rect layout
   - Review apertures and branch length adjustment.

** Circular Layout
  -
** Faces
    - Add SeqMotifFace to visualize alignments. Make Face adapatable to faces
    -
* GUI
- click on nodes --> actions
- option to modify appertures

* Performance
- reduce memory consuption
- No need to precompute face dimensions
- No need to precumpute collision paths
- update node under mouse
- option to precompute faces and calculate optimial scale/corrections

* command line tool

- link to alignments
- link to data tables (even dataframes) --> heatmap, profiles, other plots
- layout modes
