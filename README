no-overlap issue: in order to allocate space for faces, circular trees have to
   expand their radius, and the way of doing this is by increases the branch
   scale. This has an annoying effect on the actual size of faces when
   visualizaing, as they look too small when the whole tree is fit on screen.

   some faces could have an special flag that prevent the layout function to
   allocate space for them, so they are only shown when the zoom allows it.
   
   branch-right positions, however, would complicate too much the visualization,
   as it would break linear transformation of coordinates among zooming.

   Could both types of faces coexist?
  

New Features:
    - node labels (centeres on node region?)
    - node links (like in circos)
    - bands/ribbons/rings, also for internal nodes
